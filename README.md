Grajcownia is my first big project that I've made frontend for. It's not SEO compliant, the design is not responsive for small devices and it requires from me a lot of changes, so I stopped working on it. Too many things have been done in a wrong way and for now I'm going to focus on something new and maybe in the future I will create Grajcownia from scratch. - anka335
